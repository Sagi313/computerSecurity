<p>This site is vulnerable to XSS and SQL injections by purpose.
    This was made as part of project in the Computer Security course in H.I.T</p>

<p>It was done using Django, the web framework for Python.</p>

<h3>XSS</h3>
<p>
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that can be found in some web applications.
XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site
scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.
Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security vulnerabilities documented
by Symantec up until 2007. XSS effects vary in range from petty nuisance to significant security risk,
depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation
implemented by the site's owner network.

<h3>SQL Injection</h3>
<p>
SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements
are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).
SQL injection must exploit a security vulnerability in an application's software, for example, when user input is
either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not
strongly typed and unexpectedly executed. SQL injection is mostly known as an attack vector for websites but can
be used to attack any type of SQL database.

SQL injection attacks allow attackers to spoof identity, tamper with existing data, cause repudiation issues such as
voiding transactions or changing balances, allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system, destroy the
data or make it otherwise unavailable, and become administrators of the database server.
